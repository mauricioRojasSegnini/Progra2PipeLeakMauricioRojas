this is a repository for a programming project of the course of Programation 2.

The player must build or rebuild a pipe through which a fluid, usually water, will pass through. **The pipe is built on a matrix area**, where fluid arises from one or more sources and must reach one or more destinations.
The program receives the status of a game in progress by standard input or in files. The content in the standard input or in the files could be text or binary. The program **must validate, resolve, or convert the level** it receives according to the user's choice.
